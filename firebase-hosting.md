## npm install -g firebase-tools

## firebase login

## firebase init

### hosting
### Use an existing project
### Select the firebase project that you created

## Specify the BUILD !!! (that we created in the previous section), to be used as your project's public directory.

## Select whether or not you need your firebase app to be configured as a single-page app. I'm selecting No in my case.

## As we've already created a build directory in our previous section, therefore build/index.html already exists. We would want to let it be as is and enter No for this question.

## firebase deploy
